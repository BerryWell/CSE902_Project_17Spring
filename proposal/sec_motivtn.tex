The challenge of classifying fingerprint includes: 
%
1) the quality of some fingerprints images are poor; 
%
2) the inter-class dissimilarity is small and the intra-class similarity is small; 
%
3) some fingerprints can be classified into multiple classes and there exists some ambiguity in the label.

To solve these problems, many researchers propose to use handcrafted features instead of raw fingerprint images for classification and many methods have been proposed. 
%
Kai Cao \textit{et al.}\cite{cao2013fingerprint} propose to a novel method to extract fingerprint orientation feature and use a hierarchical classifier for classification.

Ruxin Wang \textit{et al.} \cite{wang2014fingerprint} also use fingerprint orientation as feature. By adopting stacked autoencoder
