Fingerprints are ridge and valley patterns presented on the surface of human fingertips.
%
Fingerprints recognition techniques are applied in many areas such as authentication, suspects identification and privacy protection.
%
Typically, to query a fingerprint, the system needs to search and match thousands of fingerprints that are stored in the database. This is a time-consuming process due to huge amount of computation.
%
To mitigate this problem, we can first classify a fingerprint into a basic type and then perform fingerprint match within fingerprints of that type.
%

%
Most of fingerprint classification problems adopts Galtonâ€“ Henry classification scheme.\cite{henry1905classification}. Thus, in this project, we are going to propose a fingerprint recognition system that classify a fingerprint into the following 5 categories:
%
A=Arch, L=Left Loop, R=Right Loop, T=Tented Arch, W=Whorl.
