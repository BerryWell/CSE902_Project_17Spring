\subsection{Deep  Learning}
In this project, we plan to develop and implement a novel deep learning algorithm for fingerprint claasifications.
%
Specifically, we will implement some state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture as baselines, such as GoogLeNet \cite{szegedy2016rethinking}.
%
Our goal is to propose a novel approach to classify fingerprints. The innovation of our approach is two-fold:

1) devise some novel CNN architecture that aims at classifying fingerprints, rather than just use some existing CNN
