In this project, we aim to develop and implement a deep learning algorithm that takes a fingerprint image as an input and classify it into one of the five pattern class types of a) Arch; b) Tented Arch; c) Left Loop; d) Right Loop; or e) Whorl. 

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
%
We will first apply raw fingerprint images to train a CNN for classification. The outputs of some intermediate layer  of CNN will be used as features for possibly a support vector machine classifier.
%
We will consider using automated extracted features (\textit{e.g.},orientation filed) as inputs for CNN training, with the goal of combining raw images and automated features as input to train CNN.

For CNN architecture, we will first use canonical architecture ( such as 5 \textit{convolutional} + 3 \textit{fully-connected} in \textit{AlexNet}\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}). We will then modify the CNN architecture to improve the performance.
%
\subsection{Classifier}
%
We will consider two classifiers. The first one is the prediction layer of CNN. The values in last layer indicates the predicted probabilities of each class.
%
The second one is support vector machine (SVM whose input features comprise of the CNNâ€™s middle or last layers.

\subsection{Data Augmentation}
%
To further improve the performance, we will use data augmentation technique to generate more training samples in order to increase the generalization ability of our model. 
%
The augmentation methods include rotation, resizing and translation.
